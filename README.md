###RotX Algorithm
This project implements the ROTX algorithm through C# language program.

RotX is a letter substitution algorithm, which replaces a letter with the X-th letter after it in the alphabet. 
One of the most common RotX algorithm is the algorithm in which X = 13. ROT13 is a special case of the Code of Caesar.
